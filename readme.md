## Note to professor
Due to [mailgun limitation](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/217531258-Authorized-Recipients) of sending emails to authorized recipients only, I have added nick.romanidis@senecacollege.ca as one of the recipient. Even after adding authorized recipient, Seneca's email is blocking the mailgun's provided domain for phising.
